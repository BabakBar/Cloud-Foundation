# When Things Go Wrong in Docker

## Help! I Can't Create More Containers

One common issue Docker users encounter is running out of space, even when their system appears to have plenty of disk space available. This usually manifests when trying to build or run containers and receiving disk space errors.

### Understanding the Problem

The issue often occurs because:

- Docker images are composed of compressed layers
- On Mac and some Windows installations, Docker engine runs in a virtual machine
- The space limitation might be within the Docker VM, not your host system

### Solutions

1. **Check Current Images**

   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

   This command lists all images, helping you identify unused ones taking up space.

2. **Remove Specific Images**

   ```bash
   docker rmi <image1> <image2> <image3>
   ```

   - Can remove multiple images at once
   - Example: `docker rmi sia/xq nginx selenium/standalone-chrome selenium/standalone-firefox`
   - Note: You might need to stop containers using these images first with `docker rm`
   - Add `-f` flag to force deletion (use with caution due to potential data loss)

3. **Use Docker System Prune**

   ```bash
   docker system prune
   ```

   This command smartly reclaims space by removing:

   - All stopped containers
   - All networks not used by at least one container
   - All dangling images
   - All dangling build cache

   > **Note**: When using this command, you'll receive a warning. You can confirm with lowercase 'y' or abort with uppercase 'N'.
   
   This command can often reclaim significant amounts of space (potentially gigabytes).

### Tips

- Always ensure containers using images are stopped before removing images
- Regular maintenance using `docker system prune` can prevent space issues
- Use `docker rm` to remove stopped containers before removing their images
- Consider using `-f` flag with `docker rmi` only when necessary, being mindful of potential data loss

After implementing these solutions, you should be able to create and run containers again successfully.
